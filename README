Quaint is a new programming language. How quaint!

Quaint aims to be a dynamic programming language that offers several
optional static properties and is easy to optimize in the average
case.

It currently in the design phase, so nothing about it is set in stone
yet.

Check the development blog for insight on the design process and/or to
give feedback.

This particular implementation is in Python 3, but once everything is
in working order, Quaint will be reimplemented in Quaint.
