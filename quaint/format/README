quaints.format
===============

This package is for formatting Quaint source code. It can be used to
highlight excerpts, do syntax highlighting, on the terminal or as
HTML.

Exports formats, highlight(), rich_error(), and others.


codehl.py

  Exports the code_highlight method, which takes a level 1 AST and a
  format, and spits out source code highlighted in that format.


errors.py

  Exports the rich_error() function, which can convert some
  QuaintSyntaxErrors into RichQuaintSyntaxErrors. Rich errors have
  very informative messages and a .highlight() method to show where
  the error is located. So when catching QuaintSyntaxError as e, try
  print(quaints.format.rich_error(e).highlight()).


format.py

  Defines "formats" for highlighting purposes: TermPlainFormat,
  TermColorFormat and HTMLFormat. Also exports the "highlight"
  function.
