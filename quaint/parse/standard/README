quaint.parse.standard
=======================

This submodule defines the Quaint programming language, using tools
in quaint.parse.generic.

It exports encode, decode, parser and a few others.


characters.py

  Defines what characters can be in an identifier.


codec.py

  Defines the delimiters for identifiers and what characters can be
  found in an identifier. Also defines all available digraphs, as well
  as many ways to encode many characters.

  Exports the encode and decode functions.


operators.py

  Defines the fixity of all major operators, and their priority with
  respect to each other. Exports op_groups and op_order, the latter of
  which can be used to determine whether an operator has priority over
  another.

  Also exports is_assignment and is_custom, to check if an operator is
  an assignment operator or a custom operator.

  * operators.pickle is a cache of op_groups and op_order, since it is
    expensive to compute them. The function
    quaint.parse.standard.operators.remove_cache can be used to
    remove it, though it will be remade on the next import.


parse.py

  Exports a parser for the Quaint syntax.
