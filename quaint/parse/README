quaint.parse
==============

The parsing submodule is organized within two sub-modules:

generic:
    This contains various classes and utilities that can be
    instantiated with various design choices (different operator
    priorities, etc.)

standard:
    All the standard Quaint semantics are contained there (how
    characters are encoded, with what delimiters, what are the
    operators, their priorities, etc.)
